Meeting: Q4 Planning Session
Date: December 15, 2024
Attendees: Sarah Johnson (Project Manager), Mike Chen (Developer), Lisa Wang (Designer), David Brown (Product Owner)

Sarah: Good morning everyone. Let's start our Q4 planning session. Our main goals today are to review the current project status, plan for the upcoming features, and set priorities for the next quarter.

Mike: I've been working on the user authentication system. It's about 80% complete. I expect to finish it by next Friday. The main challenge has been integrating with the third-party OAuth providers, but I think I've got it sorted now.

Lisa: Great! I've been designing the new dashboard interface. I have three different mockups ready for review. Sarah, when would be a good time to go through them? I think the team will love the new dark mode option.

David: That sounds excellent. Before we dive into new features, let's talk about the bug reports from last week. We received 15 customer complaints about the slow loading times on the reports page. Mike, can you look into that?

Mike: Absolutely. I suspect it's related to the database queries. I'll optimize them and add some caching. Should be able to fix it within 3-4 days.

Sarah: Perfect. Now, for Q4 priorities, we need to focus on three main areas: performance improvements, the new analytics dashboard, and mobile responsiveness. Lisa, how's the mobile design coming along?

Lisa: I'm about 60% done with the mobile layouts. The biggest challenge is making the complex data tables work well on smaller screens. I'm exploring some progressive disclosure techniques.

David: Speaking of mobile, we've had 200+ requests for a mobile app. Should we consider that for Q1 next year?

Sarah: Let's add that to our Q1 discussion list. For now, let's stick to mobile web responsiveness. What about the analytics dashboard timeline?

Mike: If Lisa can get me the final designs by December 20th, I can have a working prototype by January 10th. Full implementation would take another 3-4 weeks.

Lisa: That works for me. I'll prioritize the analytics designs this week.

Sarah: Excellent. Let's also discuss the budget. We have $50,000 allocated for Q4 development costs. $30,000 is earmarked for external API integrations, and $20,000 for additional developer resources if needed.

David: We might need those extra resources. The client is pushing hard for the multi-language support feature. It's become a high priority for their European expansion.

Sarah: Good point. Mike, how complex would multi-language support be?

Mike: It's not trivial. We'd need to internationalize the entire frontend, set up translation workflows, and modify the database schema. I'd estimate 6-8 weeks of work.

Sarah: That might push into Q1. Let's evaluate after we complete the current priorities. 

Action Items:
1. Mike to complete user authentication by December 22nd
2. Mike to fix report page performance issues by December 18th
3. Lisa to deliver analytics dashboard designs by December 20th
4. Lisa to continue mobile responsiveness work
5. Team to reconvene on January 3rd for Q1 planning
6. Sarah to prepare budget proposal for multi-language support

Next meeting: January 3rd, 2025 at 10 AM

Meeting ended: 11:30 AM
